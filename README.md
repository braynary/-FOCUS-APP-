  A simple app, built with React Native and <a href="https://snack.expo.io/@braynary/focus">Expo Snacks</a>, to help you focus on your tasks for a set amount of time.
</p>
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Input the task that you would like to focus on</li>
  <li>Choose the amount of time you would like to focus on your task</li>
  <li>Begin your task! Your phone will stay on, using expo-keep-awake, and vibrate once the timer reaches 0</li>
  <li>View a list of all of the tasks you have previously focused on and whether or not you were able to complete them</li>
</ul>
